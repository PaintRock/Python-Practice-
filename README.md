## Python-Practice
This is a review of Python coding and some learning new things. 

The goal is to practice something -- for three hours each day -- that something my be my social skills but hopefully more days will be about tools I need for data analytics, AI Engineering, and whatever else comes up.  

Time to begin...

## First, Hello

Hello really just demonstrates a couple of simple things -- I added the regular print to demo the difference from print (f)

F-strings: print(f"...{variable}...")
Regular print: print("...")

variable: var_name = input "Whatever? "
