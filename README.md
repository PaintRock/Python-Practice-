## Python-Practice
This is a review of Python coding and some learning new things. 

{Do not choose Run Code from Codespace!
Choose Run python code on terminal or enter python ./filename.py}

The goal is to practice something -- for three hours each day -- that something may be my social skills but hopefully more days will be about tools I need for data analytics, AI Engineering, and whatever else comes up.  

Time to begin...

## First, Hello

Hello really just demonstrates a couple of simple things -- I added the regular print to demo the difference from print (f)

F-strings: print(f"...{variable}...")
Regular print: print("...")

variable: var_name = input "Whatever? "

## Second, Caculate

Calculator is just a simple two digit calculator that prompts for inputs and creates a sum as input.  Again...

Print (f) is used


## Third, PYTHON FOR BEGINNERS from freeCodeCamp.org!!

Really simple with some of the basics:
**Emphasizes the indent**
**create function **
    * def fun_name():
        content
        return 
    * dict { "name": choice, "name2": choice2 }
    * list []
    * random 
        * import random
        * define the random name_of_ this = [ 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th]
